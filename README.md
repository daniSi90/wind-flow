# Wind flow Library  

The purpose of this library is to simplify the process of handling sequences of initializations (Winding) and de-initializations (Unwinding). During the winding process, each level can determine the next step based on user input or conditions. When unwinding, the process follows the same path in reverse order, going all the way back down to level 0 (root).
